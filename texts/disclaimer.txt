The feedback provided by the AI is based on the responses you have given in the survey. It is generated using advanced AI algorithms and is intended for informational purposes only. It should not be considered as professional advice. The accuracy and completeness of the AI's feedback are not guaranteed, and reliance on this feedback is at your own risk. For detailed and personalized advice, we recommend consulting with a professional in the relevant field. The "Your Scores and Comparison" section gives a comparison between an individual respondent's scores and the overall scores ever recorded. The statistics, including mean and standard deviation, are dynamically updated as and when new responses are received without human intervention. You must note that the survey statistics could be manipulated by malicious or dishonest input, and therefore should be taken as reference only. The information provided in the "Cyber Threat Situation in Your Country" and "Cyber Threat Situation in Your Industry" sections are based on automatic monitoring of cyber threat alerts published on selected sources only, and may not be interpreted as the complete picture of the actual situations.
